established, however, over the past decade, studies have identified the
ever-growing importance of phosphatases in these processes. It is well-known that
an intact or otherwise non-deformed nuclear envelope (NE) is essential for
maintaining healthy cells and any deviation from this can result in pathological 
conditions. This review aims at assessing the current understanding of how
phosphatases contribute to the remodelling of the nuclear envelope during its
disassembling and reformation after cell division and how errors in this process 
may lead to the development of diseases.",21,ASSAULT A PERSON THEREBY OCCASIONING THEM ACTUAL BODILY HARM (RECORDABLE),N
2,Violent Crime,ASSAULT,Fri,Dec,Incomplete Postcode,,"Both huge volume and high moisture content of municipal sludge have brought great
troubles and attracted extensive concerns in the world. In this paper, the
mechanical press filtration (MPF) dewatering was performed under ultrahigh
pressure in order to improve the dewatering performance of municipal sludge.
Low-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique was used to study the effect
of MPF parameters on dewatering performance. Based on the pore characteristics of
municipal sludge, a capillary bundle model was developed to explore the
mesoscopic mechanisms of MPF dewatering. The results indicate that moisture
content of sludge cake decreases gradually with the increase of compressed
pressure and dewatering time as well as the decrease of sludge weight , and the
moisture content of municipal sludge can be reduced to as low as 30% with MPF
dewatering. According to the peak and envelope area of relaxation time curve in
NMR, it can be found that the size of pores decreases and the percentage of small
pores increases during the dewatering process. Therefore, the capillary water
cannot be removed by MPF method because the capillary pressure in very small
pores increases evidently. Furthermore, the compaction degree of the outmost
layer is generally higher than that of the middle layer, and the difference of
moisture content between the middle and outmost layers of cake is 25%-28.4%. The 
present work may be helpful to understand the MPF dewatering mechanism and shed
light on the new dewatering techniques of municipal sludge.",42,COMMON ASSAULT (RECORDABLE),N
3,Violent Crime,OTHER,Fri,Jul,LS123,,"Porous uranium oxide hollow sphere nanoparticles were synthesized in ionic
liquids under hydrothermal conditions. Various precipitating agents and ionic
liquids were investigated to determine their respective impact on the resultant
uranium oxide morphologies. Using hydrazine hydrate as precipitating agent and
N-butyl pyridinium bromide as templating agent, a porous-hollow structure was
created with a surface area of 1958 m2.g-1 and an average pore diameter of 30 nm.
The nanoparticles revealed high peroxidase-mimicking activity. This was evaluated
by using the peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) that is
catalytically oxidized by H2O2 to give oxidized TMB (oxTMB) which is blue (with
an absorption peak at 652 nm). The material was used as a nanozyme for
colorimetric detection of Sn2+. Meanwhile, it is found that BSA strongly improves
the catalytic activity of the nanozyme, while Sn(II) inhibits its activity. Thus,
a colorimetric method for Sn2+ detection was designed. The method works in the
0.5-100 ?M Sn(II) concentration range and has a lower detection limit of 0.36 ?M 
(at S/N?=?3). Graphical abstract The catalytic activity of porous-hollow nano-UO2
toward the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine by H2O2 is remarkably
improved in the presence of bovine serum albumin, while tin(II) inhibits its
activity. This finding has been applied to design a method for colorimetric
quantification of tin(II) in water samples.",21,INTENTIONALLY ARRANGE / FACILITATE ENTRY INTO UK / OTHER COUNTRY OF A PERSON WITH A VIEW TO THEIR EXPLOITATION (RECORDABLE),N

Understanding the influence of colloids on radionuclide migration is of
significance to evaluate environmental risks for radioactive waste disposals. In 
order to formulate an appropriate modelling framework that can quantify and
interpret the anomalous transport of Strontium (Sr) in the absence and presence
of colloids, the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach is implemented in
this work using available experimental information. The results show that the
transport of Sr and its recovery are enhanced in the presence of colloids. The
causes can be largely attributed to the trap-release processes, e.g.
electrostatic interactions of Sr, colloids and natural sediments, and differences
in pore structures, which gave rise to the varying interstitial velocities of
dissolved and, if any, colloid-associated Sr. Good agreement between the CTRW
simulations and the column-scale observations is demonstrated. Regardless of the 
presence of colloids, the CTRW modelling captures the characteristics of
non-Fickian anomalous transport (0?<???<?2) of Sr. In particular, a range of
0?<???<?1, corresponding to the cases with greater recoveries, reveal strongly
non-Fickian transport with distinctive earlier arrivals and tailing effects,
likely due to the physicochemical heterogeneities, i.e. the repulsive
interactions and/or the macro-pores originating from local heterogeneities. The
results imply that colloids can increase the Sr transport as a barrier of Sr
sorption onto sediments herein, apart from often being carriers of sored
radionuclides in aqueous phase. From a modelling perspective, the findings show
that the established CTRW model is valid for quantifying the non-Fickian and
promoted transport of Sr with colloids.",42,SECTION 18 - WOUNDING WITH INTENT (RECORDABLE),N

Influenza viruses antagonize key immune defence mechanisms via the virulence
factor non-structural protein 1 (NS1). A key mechanism of virulence by NS1 is
blocking nuclear export of host messenger RNAs, including those encoding immune
factors1-3; however, the direct cellular target of NS1 and the mechanism of host 
mRNA export inhibition are not known. Here, we identify the target of NS1 as the 
mRNA export receptor complex, nuclear RNA export factor 1-nuclear transport
factor 2-related export protein 1 (NXF1-NXT1), which is the principal receptor
mediating docking and translocation of mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex via
interactions with nucleoporins4,5. We determined the crystal structure of NS1 in 
complex with NXF1-NXT1 at 3.8?Å resolution. The structure reveals that NS1
prevents binding of NXF1-NXT1 to nucleoporins, thereby inhibiting mRNA export
through the nuclear pore complex into the cytoplasm for translation. We
demonstrate that a mutant influenza virus deficient in binding NXF1-NXT1 does not
block host mRNA export and is attenuated. This attenuation is marked by the
release of mRNAs encoding immune factors from the nucleus. In sum, our study
uncovers the molecular basis of a major nuclear function of influenza NS1 protein
that causes potent blockage of host gene expression and contributes to inhibition
of host immunity.",56,ASSAULT BY BEATING (RECORDABLE),N
6,Violent Crime,HATE - CRIME,Mon,Feb,LS83,,"Selective transport across the nuclear envelope (NE) is mediated by the nuclear
pore complex (NPC), a massive ?100-MDa assembly composed of multiple copies of
?30 nuclear pore proteins (Nups). Recent advances have shed light on the
composition and structure of NPCs, but approaches that could map their
organization in live cells are still lacking. Here, we introduce an in vivo
method to perform nuclear radial intensity measurements (NuRIM) using
fluorescence microscopy to determine the average position of NE-localized
proteins along the nucleocytoplasmic transport axis. We apply NuRIM to study the 
organization of the NPC and the mobile transport machinery in budding yeast. This
reveals a unique snapshot of the intact yeast NPC and identifies distinct
steady-state localizations for various NE-associated proteins and nuclear
transport factors. We find that the NPC architecture is robust against
compositional changes and could also confirm that in contrast to Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, the scaffold Y complex is arranged symmetrically in the yeast NPC.
Furthermore, NuRIM was applied to probe the orientation of intrinsically
disordered FG-repeat segments, providing insight into their roles in selective
NPC permeability and structure.",78,RACIALLY / RELIGIOUSLY AGGRAVATED HARASSMENT WITHOUT VIOLENCE (RECORDABLE),N
7,Violent Crime,CRUELTY/NEGLECT,Tue,Mar,LS150,,"Background: Capsids of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) are assembled in the
nucleus, translocated either to the perinuclear space by budding at the inner
nuclear membrane acquiring tegument and envelope, or released to the cytosol in a
""naked"" state via impaired nuclear pores that finally results in impairment of
the nuclear envelope. The Us3 gene encodes a protein acting as a kinase, which is
responsible for phosphorylation of numerous viral and cellular substrates. The
Us3 kinase plays a crucial role in nucleus to cytoplasm capsid translocation. We 
thus investigate the nuclear surface in order to evaluate the significance of Us3
in maintenance of the nuclear envelope during HSV-1 infection. Methods: To
address alterations of the nuclear envelope and capsid nucleus to cytoplasm
translocation related to the function of the Us3 kinase we investigated cells
infected with wild type HSV-1 or the Us3 deletion mutant R7041(?Us3) by
transmission electron microscopy, focused ion-beam electron scanning microscopy, 
cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy, confocal super resolution light
microscopy, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results: Confocal super
resolution microscopy and cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy
revealed decrement in pore numbers in infected cells. Number and degree of pore
impairment was significantly reduced after infection with R7041(?Us3) compared to
infection with wild type HSV-1. The nuclear surface was significantly enlarged in
cells infected with any of the viruses. Morphometric analysis revealed that
additional nuclear membranes were produced forming multiple folds and caveolae,
in which virions accumulated as documented by three-dimensional reconstruction
after ion-beam scanning electron microscopy. Finally, significantly more
R7041(?Us3) capsids were retained in the nucleus than wild-type capsids whereas
the number of R7041(?Us3) capsids in the cytosol was significantly lower.
Conclusions: The data indicate that Us3 kinase is involved in facilitation of
nuclear pore impairment and, concomitantly, in capsid release through impaired
nuclear envelope.",24,COMMON ASSAULT (RECORDABLE),N

10,Violent Crime,TRAFFIC - OTHER,Wed,Nov,LS117,,"Multiphase flow phenomena in nanoporous media are encountered in many science and
engineering applications. Shales for example, possessing complex nanopore
networks, have considerable importance as source rocks for unconventional oil and
gas production and as low-permeability seals for geologic carbon sequestration or
nuclear waste disposal. This study presents a theoretical investigation of the
processes controlling adsorption, capillary condensation and imbibition in such
nanoporous media, with a particular focus on understanding the effects of
fluid-fluid and fluid-pore wall interaction forces in the interconnected nanopore
space. Building on a new theoretical framework, we developed a numerical model
for multiphase nanoporous flow and tested it against water vapor uptake
measurements conducted on a shale core sample. The model, which is based on the
density functional approach, explicitly includes the relevant interaction forces 
among fluids and solids while allowing for a continuum representation of the
porous medium. The experimental data include gravimetrically measured mass
changes in an initially dry core sample exposed to varying levels of relative
humidity, starting with a low relative humidity (rh = 0.31) followed by a period 
of a higher relative humidity (rh = 0.81). During this process, water vapor
uptake in the dry core is recorded as a function of time. Our model suggests that
under low rh conditions flow within the shale sample is controlled by adsorption 
and diffusion type processes. After increasing the rh to 0.81, the uptake of
water vapor becomes more significant, and according to our model this can be
explained by capillary condensation followed by immiscible displacement in the
core sample. It appears that strong fluid-pore wall attractive forces cause
condensation near the inlet which then induces water imbibition further into
sample.",42,CAUSE DEATH BY CARELESS / INCONSIDERATE DRIVING (RECORDABLE),N
11,Violent Crime,HATE - CRIME,Mon,Apr,LS84,,"Over the past decades, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has emerged as an
increasingly powerful tool to study the dynamics of biomolecules at nanometer
length scales. However, the more stochastic the nature of such biomolecular
dynamics, the harder it becomes to distinguish them from AFM measurement noise.
Rapid, stochastic dynamics are inherent to biological systems comprising
intrinsically disordered proteins. One role of such proteins is in the formation 
of the transport barrier of the nuclear pore complex (NPC): the selective gateway
for macromolecular traffic entering or exiting the nucleus. Here, we use AFM to
observe the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins from two systems: the
transport barrier of native NPCs and the transport barrier of a mimetic NPC made 
using a DNA origami scaffold. Analyzing data recorded with 50-200 ms temporal
resolution, we highlight the importance of drift correction and appropriate
baseline measurements in such experiments. In addition, we describe an
autocorrelation analysis to quantify time scales of observed dynamics and to
assess their veracity-an analysis protocol that lends itself to the
quantification of stochastic fluctuations in other biomolecular systems. The
results reveal the surprisingly slow rate of stochastic, collective transitions
inside mimetic NPCs, highlighting the importance of FG-nup cohesive interactions.",42,RACIALLY / RELIGIOUSLY AGGRAVATED INTENTIONAL HARASSMENT / ALARM / DISTRESS - WORDS / WRITING (RECORDABLE),N

CO-check point in photoperiodic signaling and integrated signals from multiple
pathways to directly target FT for flowering control in Arabidopsis. Flowering
regulation is an important and widely studied plant development event. Even
though nucleoporin Nup98 has been proven to play pivotal roles in the growth and 
development of mammalian cells and yeast, it is still unknown if Nup98
participates in flowering control in plants. In this study, we investigated the
function of two Nup98 homologs, Nup98a and Nup98b, in flowering regulation in
Arabidopsis. The results showed that Nup98a and Nup98b redundantly inhibit
flowering through multiple pathways including clock, photoperiod, and age
pathways. Single mutants of nup98a and nup98b do not show any obvious abnormal
phenotypes compared to wild-type plants; however, the nup98a1 nup98b1 double
mutant displays early flowering. Significantly, Nup98a/Nup98b gate flowering in a
CONSTANS (CO)-independent mode. Therefore, Nup98a/Nup98b bypasses the CO
checkpoint in photoperiodic signaling and integrated signals from multiple
pathways to directly target FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) for flowering control. In
addition, our results provide a line of genetic evidence for uncoupling the
mechanism of flowering and senescence at Nup98a/Nup98b genes in Arabidopsis,

13,Violent Crime,ASSAULT,Mon,Feb,LS74,,"A novel porous NiFe-oxide nanocubes (NiFe NCs) binary material was successfully
fabricated via a facile and scalable tactic, which involved a
morphology-inherited heat treating of Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2·xH2O prussian blue analogue
nanocubes as self-sacrificial templates. Consequently, it was demonstrated that
the NiFe NCs consisted of primary nanostructure units and interconnected pores,
with an average size of ˜80?nm. When employed as adsorbents, the as-prepared NiFe
NCs displayed remarkable adsorption capacities for heavy metal ions (232.3?mg?g-1

and 31.97?mg?g-1 for CR at 298?K). The resulting NiFe NCs further revealed
efficient regeneration and reusability even after five consecutive
adsorption/desorption cycles. The microscopic spectrum analysis demonstrated that
the interaction between As(V) and NiFe NCs was mainly ascribed to the metal-oxide
bonds (MO) and hydroxyl groups (OH), while Cr(VI) adsorption was in conjunction
with the reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Furthermore, the adsorption of 
organic dyes on NiFe NCs depended on the pore structure and molecule sizes of the
organic dye molecules. These findings make cost-efficient NiFe NCs materials a
powerful candidate for remediating water contaminated with inorganic and organic

The presence of nanoparticles lowers the levels of ultrasound (US) intensity
needed to achieve the therapeutic effect and improves the contrast between
healthy and pathological tissues. Here, we evaluate the role of two main
mechanisms that contribute to the US-induced heating of aqueous suspensions of
biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) of mesoporous silicon prepared by
electrochemical etching of heavily boron-doped crystalline silicon wafers in a
hydrofluoric acid solution. The first mechanism is associated with an increase of
the attenuation of US in the presence of NPs due to additional scattering and
viscous dissipation, which was numerically simulated and compared to the
experimental data. The second mechanism is caused by acoustic cavitation leading 
to intense bubble collapse and energy release in the vicinity of NPs. This effect
is found to be pronounced for as-called Janus NPs produced via a nano-stopper
technique, which allow us to prepare mesoporous NPs with hydrophobic inner pore
walls and hydrophilic external surface. Such Janus-like NPs trap air inside the
pores when dispersed in water. The precise measurement of the heating dynamics in
situ enabled us to detect the excessive heat production by Janus-like NPs over
their completely hydrophilic counterparts. The excessive heat is attributed to
the high intensity cavitation in the suspension of Janus-like NPs. The present
work elicits the potential of specifically designed Janus-like mesoporous silicon
NPs in the field of nanotheranostics based on ultrasound radiation.",42,ASSAULT A CONSTABLE IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS / HER DUTY (RECORDABLE),N
